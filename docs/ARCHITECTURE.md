## Architecture

### High-level overview
![Draft architecture](diagrams/draft-architecture-overview.png)

The current service-level architecture is comprised of Service Providers, the Government Identity Provider (login.gov), and the ability to verify identity within login.gov using various back-end systems (credit authorities, document verifications services, etc.) or delegate authentication to external Identity Providers.

* The current counter fraud components are related to prevention of bad requests and activities with automated reporting.

For more details on our system security, see [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).
